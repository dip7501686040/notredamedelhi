			<p><strong style="color: red; font-weight: 900;">Goodbye Sir Jose</strong></p>
<p>Goodbyes are only for those who love with their eyes. Because, for those who love with their heart and soul, there is no such thing as separation! But for every beginning, there must be an end. It’s paradoxical but that’s how it is.</p>
<p><strong>On January 18, 2020,</strong> the entire Notre Dame family gathered to bid farewell to an exceptional teacher, an altruistic human being, Sir Jose. The beauty of the stage was enhanced by an aesthetically pleasing backdrop and the lamp waiting to be lighted. The amazing programme began with a prayer song and a prayer dance. The students were beautifully dressed and they presented a number of dance performances. Students presented some skits, followed by speeches appreciating the nature of Sir Jose.</p>
<p>This sense of humour and his dressing sense would be adamantly admired by everyone. He would be remembered by many students as a guide and mentor who helped shape their lives for the better. He is extremely charismatic and knew how to interact with his students on a personal level. He knew the art of adding charm to even the most boring lesson.</p>
<p>His finesse and his passion for literature gave him an unmatched ability to add life to mere fictional characters. The programme ended with a song by the choir, melodiously sung.</p>
<p>Lastly, Sir Jose expressed his feelings, his experiences and his journey in Notre Dame School after which Sr. Alice appreciated Sir and blessed the gathering. The day was great, filled with nostalgia, fun and excitement. Saying good bye is never easy. But, that is a bitter truth of life.</p>

<p>Christmas is the festival which inspires the spirit if sharing and caring. Soaking in the spirit of Christmas, the students of Notre Dame School celebrated the festival of Christmas with enthusiasm on the <strong>21<sup>st</sup> of December 2019</strong>.</p>
<p>Leaving no stone unturned to sprinkle the magic of their love, the stage was wholly decorated by the students. The programme started with a prayer dance followed by a beautifully staged skit, directed by Sir Jose, depicting the significance of the festival, showcasing the life and journey of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The elements of energy and momentum could be witnessed in the children as they came forward and presented their items. Lastly the much awaited Santa Claus entered the stage with his elves and reindeers, boasting up the energy level of the students. A brief history of Santa Claus was depicted through dance and narrations. The programme ended with the choir singing melodious carols.</p>
<p>The Principal, Sr. Mary Alice threw light on the importance of the day and blessed the gathering with her inspirational words.</p>

<p>The student cultural program is an innovative initiative by the CBSE to promote healthy and amicable environment amongst students of two schools. It not only unites two school groups but also promotes friendship in an effective way to build bridges among students from different backgrounds.</p>
<p>Under this program Notre Dame School Badarpur and GBSSS No 1 Badarpur, had their cultural exchange on <strong>22October and 24 October 2019.</strong> On the 22nd , 30 boys from Notre Dame School visited GBSSS No1 Badarpur, where they were welcomed by the Principal, Staff and students with lot of warmth and affection. The students of both the schools exhibited their talent through skit, dance , mime and a patriotic song. Mr Shailender , Cluster Resource Centre Coordinator encouraged the students by his motivating speech and also taught a song to the students of both the schools. Students of both the schools interacted with each other and shared food amongst themselves.</p>
<p>In the second spell the gracious Notre Dame family received neighbouring school guests with lot of warmth and affection on the 24th of October 2019 by our school Principal Sr Mary Alice , staff members and other students with the school band which made it more special for them. As a tradition of Notre Dame School, the program started with a solemn prayer song and a welcome speech by the Principal. It was followed by patriotic song by the students of Notre Dame School. The guest school presented few cultural programs like action song, skits on social issues as ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padao Yojna’. They beautifully explained how education and employment of women is essential for the progress of our country. Students also discussed how plastic is damaging our environment. Few games were also organized in which children demonstrated exemplary spirit and had great fun. The students let their taste buds experience and relish the Indian delicacies with much taste and fun.</p>

<p>Resource person – Mrs.Kavita Iyer</p>
<p>“I never dreamed about success, I worked for it”- Estee Lauder</p>
<p>Methods very logical, practical and pragmatic was shared by Ms.Kavita Iyer from Orient Black Swan Publication on classroom management.</p>
<p>She emphasized on managing learners, resources and the room(space). Her inputs were then implemented in the class room by the staff and found it to be very suitable. Critical thinking, technology and other life skills has now become a part of everyday teaching. Students now seem to be enjoying their lessons!</p>
<p><strong>Thanks to Mrs.Kavita Iyer!</strong></p>
