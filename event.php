<h3>Goodbye Sir Jose</h3>
Goodbyes are only for those who love with their eyes. Because, for those who love with their heart and soul,
 there is no such thing as separation! But for every beginning, there must be an end. It's paradoxical but that's how it is.<br><br>

<b>On January 18, 2020</b>, the entire Notre Dame family gathered to bid farewell to an exceptional teacher, an altruistic human being, Sir 
Jose. The beauty of the stage was enhanced by an aesthetically pleasing backdrop and the lamp waiting to be lighted. The amazing 
programme began with a prayer song and a prayer dance. The students were beautifully dressed and they presented a number of dance
 performances. Students presented some skits, followed by speeches appreciating the nature of Sir Jose.<br><br>

This sense of humour and his dressing sense would be adamantly admired by everyone. He would be remembered by many students
 as a guide and mentor who helped shape their lives for the better. He is extremely charismatic and knew how to interact with
 his students on a personal level. He knew the art of adding charm to even the most boring lesson.<br><br>

His finesse and his passion for literature gave him an unmatched ability to add life to mere fictional characters. 
The programme ended with a song by the choir, melodiously sung.<br><br>

Lastly, Sir Jose expressed his feelings, his experiences and his journey in Notre Dame School after which Sr.
 Alice appreciated Sir and blessed the gathering. The day was great, filled with nostalgia, fun and excitement. 
 Saying good bye is never easy. But, that is a bitter truth of life.<br><br>

<h3>Graduation Ceremony and Farewell</h3>
"Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did do.
 So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbour. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore, Dream, Discover."
